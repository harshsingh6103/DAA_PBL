PROBLEM STATEMENT :
Huffman Coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The problem is to encode given data into a smaller size using the frequency of characters while ensuring the encoding is Huffman Coding is a widely used lossless data compression algorithm. It assigns variable-length binary codes to input characters, with shorter codes given to more frequently occurring characters. This ensures efficient data representation while maintaining unique decodability, meaning no code is a prefix of another.
The problem involves encoding given data into smaller sizes using character frequency and decoding it back to its original form.

MOTIVATION:
Efficient data storage and transmission are pivotal in today’s digital world, where vast amounts of data are generated, shared, and stored daily. Huffman Coding addresses the need for optimized data representation by significantly reducing storage requirements and improving bandwidth utilization. Its practical applications span a wide range of domains, such as:
• File Compression: Used in ZIP and GZIP formats to minimize file sizes.
• Media Encoding: Integral in MP3 audio encoding and JPEG image compression to ensure smaller file sizes without compromising quality.
• Telecommunications: Plays a key role in encoding data for efficient transmission across networks.
• Real-Time Systems: Facilitates faster data access and processing due to reduced memory usage.
The algorithm exemplifies how theoretical computing principles can be leveraged to solve real-world problems. Its relevance is amplified in scenarios like IoT devices, where minimal storage and low-power operations are critical.Here we have emphasized and demonstrated the effectiveness of the procedure of the Backtracking approach through visual representation.


                         By exploring and implementing Huffman Coding, we not only gain insight into data compression
                         techniques but also learn to optimize solutions for efficiency—a skill that is essential for 
                         addressing broader computational challenges.   
Algorithm(with Analysis)
Huffman Coding works as follows:
• Calculate the frequency of each character in the input data.
 
• Create a priority queue (min-heap) where each node represents a character and its frequency.


 
                              
                             Huffman tree of ‘aaaabbbbcdefghjklmnoprsaabb’.

                       • While there is more than one node in the queue:
               Remove the two nodes with the smallest frequencies.
                     Create a new node with these two nodes as children and a frequency equal to the sum of their frequencies.
               Insert the new node back into the priority queue.

           • The remaining node is the root of the Huffman tree.
           • Traverse the tree to assign codes to characters (0 for left, 1 for right).

         
Complexity Analysis:
                
                  Time Complexity: O (n log n) for building the priority queue and tree traversal, where n is the 
                 number of  unique characters.
            Space Complexity: O (n) for storing the tree structure and codes.


 
Simple Implementation
                    The implementation of Huffman coding would follow the core steps of the algorithm but may
                    lack optimizations like using a priority queue (min-heap). Instead, the steps could be implemented using a
                    less efficient approach, for example:
              Frequency Calculation: Count the frequency of each character in the input string.
              Sorting: Sort the characters by frequency.
              Tree Construction:
                    Instead of using a priority queue (min-heap), the nodes could be sorted each time to select the two smallest  
                    frequencies.
        The nodes with the lowest frequencies are selected to form a tree.


Huffman Coding Algorithm
1)	Calculate Frequency of Each Character

2)	Insert these nodes into a priority queue (or min-heap), which will allow the smallest frequency nodes to be accessed quickly.
3)	While there is more than one node in the priority queue:
      Extract the two nodes with the smallest frequencies.
      Create a new internal node with a frequency equal to the sum of the two nodes.
      Assign the extracted nodes as children of the new node.
      Insert this new node back into the priority queue.
                 Continue this process until only one node remains in the priority queue, which will be the root of the Huffman tree.
4)	Traverse the tree from the root to each leaf node
5)	Encode the Data.

a)	Replace each character in the input data with its corresponding Huffman code from the generated tree.
b)	The output will be the encoded data, which is typically more compact than the original..
 
 
IMPLEMENTATION
The Huffman Coding algorithm, which is a lossless data compression method, can be implemented efficiently using a greedy approach.
While various methods can be employed to solve the data compression problem, Huffman Coding stands out because of its ability to generate a
variable-length encoding that minimizes the overall file size. In this implementation, the algorithm uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always
combine the least frequent characters, ensuring the optimal encoding.
